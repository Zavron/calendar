==== README ====
Thanks for downloading my HTML Calendar. This implementation
is fully customizeable, for details how to configure, read
./php/config.php and ./install/INSTALL.txt.
This calendar requires PHP to be enabled and a MySQL database.
Further instructions how to install this calendar can be found
in ./install/.
To ease configuration, this calendar includes a third-party-jQuery
extension called 'maphighlight.js'. For details see the license or
visit him over at 'http://davidlynch.org'.
The user frontend works even without javascript, the admin backend
does require javascript.
